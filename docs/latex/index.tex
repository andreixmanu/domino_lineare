Interactive game written in C language where you have a set of n cards of given combinations, and can place them on a table. Every piece has two sides, and you can only place a piece beside another piece if the adjacent sides have the same number. The game ends when you don\textquotesingle{}t have any more pieces, or when you cannot place any more pieces.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Welcome to Linear Domino}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
There are two main gamemodes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Linear Domino
\item (Not) Linear Domino
\end{DoxyItemize}

As the names suggest, {\bfseries{Linear Domino}} develops on a 1-\/dimension table, where you can play your cards either on the left side, or on the right side.

In $\ast$$\ast$(Not) Linear Domino$\ast$$\ast$ you can also place your pieces \textquotesingle{}vertically\textquotesingle{}, which develops your table in 2 dimensions. One side of the piece will be on the same row, while the other will be placed on the row below. You can create more than one binary tree in this way, and any tree can be as long as you can.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Play against yourself or let the computer play!}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
If you don\textquotesingle{}t feel like playing, you can make the computer play, and see how it solves the puzzle with the given pieces.
